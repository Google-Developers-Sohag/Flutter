<h1>All needed information you need to know about Flutter</h1>

<h2>1. What is Flutter?</h2>

Flutter is a UI-based tool for creating mobile applications. You can use Flutter to create natively compiled mobile applications with a single programming language and a single codebase. Fast and beautiful mobile applications can be developed with the right skill sets to code in Flutter. Google developed the framework, and the code is open source. Flutter in itself is not a language, and it makes use of Dart language for coding.

Flutter can be used to code for both IOS and Android. The optimization is best suited for 2D mobile apps. The following features can be used to make the apps:-

* Geolocation
* Storage access
* Camera access
* Network
* Third-Party SDKs

<h2>2. What are the advantages of using Flutter?</h2>

Flutter has various advantages to coding mobile apps:-

1. Reduce the amount of code- Hot reload feature provided by Flutter helps in faster performance. The app is coded in C/C++ code to make it as close to machine code as possible for faster app development. The widget availability in Flutter reduces the time spent on coding and uses reusable code.
2. Cross-Platform development- Flutter code can be used across platforms to reduce the effort on the development team's side.
3. Live and Hot Reloading- It helps write the code faster and more easily. The code can be easily modified when a change is made.
4. Works like a Native app- Flutter code is as close to machine code as possible. This reduces the errors due to the interpretation of code. The app works in a native environment, and the coded apps are fast and easy to use.
5. Community- Flutter has a thriving community to help you with the questions you might have.
6. Minimal Code- The Flutter app is coded using the Dart programming language. This increases the speed of development, and the UI is fast. Dart uses JIT and AOT compilation which is very fast.
7. Faster documentation- It has fast and well-organized documentation. The central depository stores the documents for future reference.
8. Customized designs- The customized layered architecture allows the designing of custom designs, faster rendering and expressive UIs.

<h2>3. What is the Flutter architecture?</h2>

Flutter has a three-layered architecture:-

1. Upper Layer: The upper layer consists of the Dart programming language along with the widgets, animations, illustrations, customizations, etc.
2. The middle layer or the Flutter Engine: This layer deals with text display, formatting, layout, etc.
3. Bottom Layer or the built-in service: This layer is for managing plugins or packages.

<h2>4. What build modes are available in Flutter?</h2>

Flutter is made up of three build modes: -

1. Debug Mode- This mode is for debugging apps on a device or a simulator.
2. Profile Mode- Some debugging abilities are available, along with an analysis of app's performance in testing rounds.
3. Release Mode- This mode is used when deploying the app. This mode is for faster performance. You cannot debug or edit the code in this mode.

<h2>5. What is the Dart programming language?</h2>

Dart is an object-oriented programming language with a syntax like the C Language. The language is open source and was developed by Google in 2011. The language was conceptualized to code the mobile app frontend. The app is used for coding frontend user interfaces. Flutter apps make use of the Dart programming language.

<h2>6. Is Dart language necessary for Flutter?</h2>

It is compulsory to know the Dart language to use Flutter. Flutter applications make use of the Dart language for coding mobile phone apps.

<h2>7. What are widgets in Flutter?</h2>

Flutter apps make use of widgets to code mobile phone applications. You will almost exclusively build on Flutter using widgets. Widgets define the view of the app. When you change the code, the widget code is automatically adjusted. Widgets are nested with each other to get the final design of the app. This means the widget is the base on which the app is coded.

<h2>8. What are the most useful editors for Flutter apps?</h2>

Flutter tools make use of plugins to code mobile phone apps. The plugins can help in Dart code compilation, analysis of the code, and development of apps. Some used Flutter tools for IDE development are

* Visual Studio
* Android Studio
* Xcode
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Eclipse
* Emacs

<h2>9. What are packages and plugins in Flutter?</h2>

Similar types of classes, interfaces, and sub-packages are known as packages in Flutter or any other object-oriented language. The packages and plugins are used in development to reduce the coder's effort. The coder need not write the code for everything and can use packages and plugins to reduce the coding effort.

The distinction between packages and plugins is minute. Packages are new components or written code in Dart language. Plugins, on the other hand, use native code to allow more functionality. Sometimes the two terms are confused as the same, but a minute distinction exists.

<h2>10. Are there any popular apps which make use of Flutter?</h2>

There are many popular apps which use Flutter. Some of the apps are:-

* Reflectly
* Google Ads
* Alibaba
* Tencent
* Birch Finance

And many more. The use of Flutter in mobile applications is very high. 

<h2>11. In What technology is Flutter built?</h2>

Flutter is built using C, C++, Skia - 2D rendering engine, and Dart-object-oriented language. 
21. Difference between runApp() and main() in flutter.

__main()__

    It is a function used to start the program. 
    In Flutter, it is impossible to write any program without the main() function.  

__runApp()__

    It is used to return the widgets that are connected to the screen as the root of the widget tree to be rendered on the screen. 
    This function is called the main function and is also the driver of the app. 

<h2>12.What is the App state?</h2>

App State is a shared state or application state. App states can be shared across sections of your app and maintain user sessions in the same way. App state includes activities such as login info, user preferences, E-commerce shopping cart, social networking notifications, etc.
